This is a repository for CIS 3500 at the University of Pennsylvania. It is used for learning about github actions through HW2. The tutorial was followed. I enjoyed discussing the scripts with Claude and understanding more about the topic at hand. you can read about my conversation in the pdfs in this repository!
